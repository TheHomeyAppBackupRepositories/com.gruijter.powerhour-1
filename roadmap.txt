
* use measure_power for min/max when available
* settable power averageing time (0 - 15? minutes)
* use measure_water and measure_gas for min/max when available???
* add this_hour prediction (and this_day, this_month, this_year)?
* Calculate money based on kWh difference per hour/day/month/year, in stead of every update, taking last tariff switch into account?

* need to use lastUpdated? to check for new meter values?
* use lastUpdated as timestamp for polls?

* optimize code > reset /set min_max remove double code
* sort order when pairing
* store all values from all devices on app unload
* Fix measure_power_avg not correct on hourly poll (resets to 0)
* add report prices today / tomorrow per hour? How? (is included as token in trigger new_prices)


dap_e:
* Add own API key setting ?

DAP:
* flow cards for high prices
* Nordpool NO2 NO_Norway_2NSL only returns 1 day (tomorrow, not today)
* Multiple markup periods per day (Denmark) https://community.homey.app/t/app-pro-power-by-the-hour-insights-per-hour-day-month-and-year/20535/857
* flow cards: price_lowest_avg_before
* flow cards: price_highest_avg_before
* create flow for lowest/highest in next24h? Or change existing 8 > 24?

* remove old migration stuff

To Do 5.3.1
* And-card 'usage is xx% below budget' 'usage is xx% above budget'?
* better icons?
* investigate why DAP needs state.this_day_avg / .next_8h_avg
* improve or remove Watts from summarizer
* add EEX gas prices

* BUG? ‘fixed markup’ rate via flow > immediate tariff update?? setFixedMarkup DAP > summarizer updateTariffHistory
* add 4 fixed tariff timeslots DAP
* check open issues: https://github.com/gruijter/com.gruijter.powerhour/issues
* rewrite Gas and Water summarizer capabilities pair and listeners like done in power
* add avg tariff last 30 days in DAP?
* auto currency based on language?


* added AI translations for multiple DAP markups 

5.4.1 done:
